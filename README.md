Experiment making a remote desktop control using node, robotjs, and electron


This is a proof of concept project - a remote desktop viewer using nodejs, and robotjs. the desktop screen server broadcasts screen updates as bitmap tiles to a client, which displays the tiles on an html canvas. the client is created with electron, but could be a simple html+javascript page.
